# Riley Appointment Assistant 🤖📞

An AI-powered voice calling automation system built using Vapi, Twilio,
Make.com, and Google Sheets.

This project automates appointment scheduling for a multi-specialty
health clinic using no-code / low-code tools.

## 🧠 Project Overview

Riley is an AI voice assistant that communicates with patients over phone calls.
It can understand user intent and assist with appointment-related tasks such as
booking, rescheduling, cancellation, verification, and notes updates.

The system is designed without a traditional backend and relies on
AI voice platforms and automation workflows.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Actually Used)

- **Vapi** – AI voice assistant platform  
- **Twilio** – Phone calling & telephony  
- **Make.com** – Automation and workflow orchestration  
- **Google Sheets** – Appointment database  
- **GitHub** – Project documentation & version control  

## 📁 Project Structure


## 🔄 How the System Works

1. Phone numbers and appointment data are stored in Google Sheets  
2. Vapi initiates inbound or outbound calls using Twilio  
3. Riley listens to the user and detects intent  
4. Structured outputs are generated by the assistant  
5. Make.com updates appointment status in Google Sheets  
6. Call results can be viewed in Vapi call logs

## 🧪 Example Use Case

A patient receives a call from the clinic →  
They request an appointment →  
Riley confirms the details →  
Appointment status is updated automatically in Google Sheets.

---

## 🧩 Assistant Configuration

The assistant behavior is controlled using configuration and prompt files:

- `config/assistant_config.json`  
  Defines assistant name, language, supported intents, and fallback message.

- `docs/assistant_prompt.md`  
  Defines system prompt, role, tone, and conversation style of the assistant.

These files allow easy customization without modifying automation workflows.
